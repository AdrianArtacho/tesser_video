# Tesser_video

This devide does video and image operations, has parameters accessible via midi, and paths and other configurations via clip names.

---

## Loading slides

Use the clip name. There are 2 slots for slides, each with a transparency slider that can be controlled via midi as well. The following example loads an image to the slot 1:

`slide1 "Macintosh HD:/Users/artacho/Desktop/Herschel Project/slides/Herschel - TITLE.png"`

The next one will load an image onto the second slot:

`slide2 "Macintosh HD:/Users/artacho/Desktop/Herschel Project/slides/planeten11.png"`

The transparency can be controlled using CC. The specific CC numbers can be stored with the set (see `storage` button).
